# FizzBuzz

A simple repo of finished FizzBuzz problems in different programming languages. So far, I am doing it in Python, Java, JS, Go, and Rust. I will add more languages as I learn them. This serves a similar purpose to the [random-test.rs](https://github.com/brittmouse/random_test.rs) repo as a way to practice some programming fundamentals. I think i will do something like this for the other random test programs i have written instead of just keeping them as local files.
